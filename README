jaw muscle, neck muscle, or motion artifacts present, 
or brain with all artifacts simultaneously present. 
Also contained is a copy of the iCanClean plugin for EEGLAB 
and a set of other helpful scripts that enable parameter sweep 
testing and validation with ground truth knowledge of the brain 
signals of interest. Please see derivatives folder and
